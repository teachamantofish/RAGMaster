Multi-Epoch Training Pipeline for Embedding Models
===================================================

WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
---------------------
This script orchestrates a complete training workflow for fine-tuning an embedding model.
It handles everything from combining datasets to running multiple training epochs.

The pipeline follows these steps:
1. COMBINE: Merge training data from multiple sources (e.g., JSX and MIF documentation)
2. SHUFFLE: Randomly mix the combined data for better training
3. TOKENIZE: Convert text into tokens the model can understand
4. TRAIN: Fine-tune the model on your combined dataset
5. SAVE: Store the trained model for later use

WHY USE THIS SCRIPT:
-------------------
- Automatically combines data from multiple directories (configured in DOCLIST)
- Ensures random shuffling for better model generalization
- Handles multi-epoch training (training in stages with progressively harder examples)
- Manages model paths between epochs automatically
- Backs up configuration files before making changes
- Provides detailed logging so you know what's happening

CONFIGURATION:
-------------
Before running, edit scripts/config_embed_training.py to set:
- DOCLIST: Array of directory names containing your training data
  Example: ["extendscript", "mifref"] 
  These are subdirectories under BASE_CWD that contain embedding_training_data folders
  
- BASE_CWD: Base path where your data directories live
  Example: Path("C:/GIT/AI_DataSource/framemaker")
  
- TRAINING_CONFIG: Model settings like batch size, learning rate, LoRA parameters
  
- OUTPUT_MODEL_PATH: Where to save the fine-tuned model

USAGE EXAMPLES:
--------------
Basic usage (single epoch with combined datasets):  python run_multi_epoch_training.py --epochs 1

Multi-epoch training (curriculum learning): python run_multi_epoch_training.py --epochs 3 --start-epoch 1

Skip combining if you already combined the data: python run_multi_epoch_training.py --epochs 1 --skip-combine

See what would happen without actually running: python run_multi_epoch_training.py --epochs 1 --dry-run

Resume from epoch 2 (if epoch 1 already completed): python run_multi_epoch_training.py --epochs 3 --start-epoch 2

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS:
--------------------
--epochs N          : How many training epochs to run (1-3, default: 3)
--start-epoch N     : Which epoch to start from (1-3, default: 1)
--skip-combine      : Don't combine datasets (use existing combined data)
--skip-tokenization : Don't tokenize data (use existing tokenized data)
--dry-run          : Show what would be done without executing

HOW MULTI-EPOCH TRAINING WORKS:
-------------------------------
Epoch 1: Train on your combined dataset with easy negatives
         Model learns basic patterns
         Saves to: OUTPUT_MODEL_PATH

Epoch 2: Load the epoch 1 model, train on medium difficulty negatives
         Model refines its understanding
         Saves to: OUTPUT_MODEL_PATH-epoch2

Epoch 3: Load the epoch 2 model, train on hard negatives
         Model masters difficult distinctions
         Saves to: OUTPUT_MODEL_PATH-epoch3

This progressive difficulty is called "curriculum learning" and often produces
better results than training on all data at once.

DATA STRUCTURE EXPECTED:
-----------------------
Your training data should be organized like this:

C:/GIT/AI_DataSource/framemaker/
├── extendscript/
│   └── embedding_training_data/
│       ├── triplets_train.json  (required)
│       └── triplets_test.json   (optional)
├── mifref/
│   └── embedding_training_data/
│       ├── triplets_train.json  (required)
│       └── triplets_test.json   (optional)

Each triplets JSON file contains an array of training examples:
[
    {
        "anchor": "Query text or question",
        "positive": "Relevant answer or passage",
        "negative": "Irrelevant passage"
    },
    ...
]

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU RUN THIS:
-------------------------------
1. The script reads DOCLIST from config (e.g., ["extendscript", "mifref"])
2. For each directory, it loads triplets_train.json and triplets_test.json
3. All triplets are combined into one large dataset
4. The combined dataset is shuffled with a random seed
5. Combined data is saved to TRAINING_DATA_DIR (first item in DOCLIST by default)
6. The tokenizer converts text to model-readable format
7. The training script fine-tunes the model on your data
8. The trained model is saved to OUTPUT_MODEL_PATH

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
Error: "No training data found in any source"
→ Check that your directories match DOCLIST entries
→ Verify triplets_train.json files exist in each embedding_training_data folder

Error: "Training failed"
→ Check GPU memory (run nvidia-smi)
→ Reduce batch_size in config if out of memory
→ Enable gradient_checkpointing if available

Config changes not taking effect:
→ Script backs up and modifies config during multi-epoch runs
→ Check for timestamped backup files: config_embed_training_backup_*.py
→ The config reflects the last epoch run (this is intentional)

DEPENDENCIES:
------------
This script requires the following to be set up:
- Python virtual environment (.venv)
- PyTorch with CUDA support
- sentence-transformers library
- Your training data prepared as triplets JSON files
- 2tokenize_triplets.py (handles tokenization)
- 4embedmodel_finetuner.py (handles training)

def combine_datasets():

    1. Loops through each difficulty level (easy, medium, hard)
    2. For each difficulty, loops through each directory in DOCLIST (e.g., "extendscript", "mifref")
    3. Loads triplets_train.json and triplets_test.json from each source's difficulty subdirectory
    4. Combines all training triplets for that difficulty into one large list
    5. Combines all test triplets for that difficulty into one large list
    6. Shuffles both lists with a time-based random seed
    7. Saves the combined, shuffled data to TRAINING_DATA_DIR/difficulty/
    
    WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT:
    - Training on diverse data sources improves model generalization
    - Shuffling prevents the model from learning source-specific biases
    - Different shuffle each run (time-based seed) helps avoid overfitting patterns
    - Combined data means one training run covers all your domains at each difficulty level

    - True if successful (found training data and saved combined versions for all difficulties)
    - False if no training data found in any source for any difficulty
